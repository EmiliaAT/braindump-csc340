## About Me

I am a long-time computer science enthusiast and have been studying computer science
independently since early high school. I am very well versed with operating systems,
embedded systems, compilers, programming languages / programming languages theory,
computer hardware and computer engineering, and game development. I do independent
research on functional programming language(s / theory) in my spare time. My first
ever program I wrote was written in pure binary, and injected into a program ROM.

## My CSC340 Goals

Demonstrate familiarity with software engineering principles and web development.
Most material I am already very familiar with, so my intent is to demonstrate that
pre-existing knowledge. Demonstrate ability to consume and produce REST APIs, and
to create a three-tier web application.
