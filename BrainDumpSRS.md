## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Document Purpose

The purpose for the Software Requirements Specification is to describe the guest, user, and author client
requirements for the BrainDump web application.

Guest-oriented requirements describe the system from the guest user's perspective. Guest users are those who visit
the BrainDump site without signing in and authenticating. All other user roles share the same capabilities as guests.

User-oriented requirements describe the system from the authenticated user's perspective. All users have access to
everything that guests can do, as well as being able to contribute to the system. Furthermore, while all users have
the ability to be authors, the user role is being defined as it is to support the larger project specification.

Author-oriented requirements describe the system from the authenticated author's perspective. While all users have
access to author capabilities, the author role is defined to demonstrates what requirements must be set in place
to support authorship features for the application.

### 1.2 Product Scope

The BrainDump platform is designed to make writing, storing, and sharing information in the form of educational
articles easy. All articles are composed of simple Markdown, and can be downloaded for offline use at any time.

The platform intentionally has features designed to make finding others' articles easier; using a tagging system,
a collections/albums system, and multiple filtering and sorting options. All authenticated users are able to view articles, create articles publically or privately, and curate articles to their liking.

BrainDump is, above all else, lightweight and accessible for users of all kinds.

### 1.5 Document Overview

Section 1 is a general introduction to the document, intended for any readers. Section 2 is focused on the product
and its features. This section is for customers and business stakeholders. Section 3 specifies the requirements for
the product and development process. This section is intended for all stakeholders, especially the development team.

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Product Functions

Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.

### 2.2 Product Constraints

This subsection should provide a general description of any other items that will limit the developerâ€™s options. These may include:  

### 2.3 User Characteristics

Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from those who are less important to satisfy.

### 2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies

List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).
