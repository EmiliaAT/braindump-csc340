## About Me
I was exposed to computers at a young age in the form of video games which formed the foundation of my relationship to the machines. 
After growing up and trying a few other fields I decided I would come back to computers to see if I could find something that interested me. 
I eventually found Cybersecurity and decided it seemed interesting and fun to get into. Since then I have made my way towards my degree.

## My CSC340 Goals
I hope to become familiar with using Github and many other essential real world tools to facilitate future projects. 
I also want to take the experience from this class to approach a real job environment with a sense of confidence.
